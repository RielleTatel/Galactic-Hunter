# 🌌 Galactic Hunter: A Data Structures Arcade Shooter

**Galactic Hunter** is a fast-paced, top-down 2D arcade shooter built with **C++** and **SDL2**, where players control a spaceship and aim a movable gun sight to eliminate waves of alien invaders. Inspired by traditional fish hunter arcade games and reimagined with a sci-fi twist, the game challenges players to score as high as possible within a limited time by shooting enemies of various types, behaviors, and values.

## 🧩 Academic Focus: Data Structures in Action

This project is developed as part of a **Data Structures course** and integrates key algorithms and structures directly into gameplay logic:

- 🔁 **Stacks**: Manage laser projectile history (e.g., undo test shots or ammo tracking)
- ⏳ **Queues**: Handle enemy spawn timing, animation effects, and event scheduling
- 🌲 **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Implement a high-score leaderboard with efficient sorting, insertion, and retrieval

These data structures are not just academic — they **functionally power the game's real-time systems**, demonstrating how classic algorithmic thinking can be applied in an interactive entertainment context.
